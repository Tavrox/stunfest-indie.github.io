__*Papy stampy*__ is a 2D side scrolling platformer running on both *Android* and *OUYA*.
Stampy is a retired Postman. When he was younger he was considered as a hero. He was an alternative against hackers and delivered mails all over the world.
One day, he discovered a huge amount of mails spread all over the city and decided to distribute all the lost mails and to discover what happened.
__*You*__  help Stampy in his quest by controlling his movements while he walks, rides his bike or pilots an helicopter.
